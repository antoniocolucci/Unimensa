 Unimensa is a Progressive Web App made by **Antonio Colucci**, **Antonio Sarno** and **Jonathan De Michele** for the project of Web Technologies (University of Naples Parthenope).
 
 
The goal of the app is to optimize the management of a university canteen and to speed up the order of meals.
The app consists of a client side and a server side:

-Through the server side the chef can load the plates by entering a name, price and an image. 
-Through the client side students and professors can order the plates loaded by the chef.
